How to Evaluate Your Startup Like a VC

## Startup Survival Guide
I'd forgotten how bad it can get when you're launching a new business. I didn't remember the depth of fatigue; the pressure of financial hemorrhage; the overwhelm that comes from a continually urgent and impossibly long to-do list.

## Here are some of the questions we struggled with:
- What time can we get started in the morning?
- Do we both need to be present to perform certain tasks?
- What is the range of appropriate tones of voice when speaking with each other, particularly when one or both of us is under duress?
- How do we prioritize problems that need solving?
- Was that response rude or was the preceding comment overbearing?
- How much conversation do we need to have about particular issues of controversy?
- How much time do we need for interviewing candidates?
- How big should we make the sign on the building?
- What is the best way to solve an engineering problem on a custom piece of furniture?
- What the acceptable level of snippy-ness is during a stressful time?
- How much should we push our independent contractors?
- Where is the line between pushy and assertive?
- When should we bring up peeves for discussion and when is it best to let them go?
- What is happening to us and our relationship? Is it normal to feel this bad?
